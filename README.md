Text to Speech App with Python and Tkinter
What is this?
This is a simple and fun app that lets you convert any text you type into spoken words. Built using Python, it has a clean and easy-to-use interface, so you can hear your text read aloud or save it as an audio file for later.
Why should you use it?
Imagine you want to listen to an article, a story, or just some notes instead of reading. This app helps by turning your text into speech. It’s great for learning, multitasking, or just for fun!
How does it work?
- Type your text: Just enter whatever you want in the big text box.
- Pick your voice: Choose to hear it in a male or female voice.
- Set the speed: Want it fast, normal, or slow? You decide.
- Listen or save: Press Speak to hear it right away or Save to keep an audio file.

What’s inside the code?
- Uses *Tkinter* to build the window, buttons, text box, and dropdown menus.
- Uses *pyttsx3* for text-to-speech, which means it works offline and sounds natural.
- Lets you save your speech as an MP3 file in any folder you pick.
- Simple, clean design with some nice icons to make it look good.
