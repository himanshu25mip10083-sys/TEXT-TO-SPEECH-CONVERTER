# TEXT-TO-SPEECH-CONVERTER
This Python project is a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) desktop application developed with Tkinter for the GUI and pyttsx3 for speech synthesis. It allows users to input text, select voice gender (male or female), and speed (fast, normal, slow) for speech output. The app supports playing the speech aloud or saving it as an audio file (mp3)
