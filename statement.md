Problem Statement
Many users, especially those with reading disabilities or people who prefer auditory learning, need to convert written text into speech. Existing solutions can require internet access, be difficult to install, or lack user-friendly interfaces. This project solves that by offering a simple, offline tool for converting any text to speech in a convenient way using Python.


Scope of the Project
This project provides a desktop application with a graphical interface that allows users to:
- Input or paste any text they wish to hear out loud
- Customize the voice (male/female) and speed (slow, normal, fast)
- Listen to the spoken version immediately or save it as an MP3 file for later
It is designed to be lightweight, work offline, and support basic customizations for voice playback.


 Target Users
- Students and professionals who want to listen to notes or documents
- Visually impaired or dyslexic users needing digital voice support
- Anyone seeking a simple, offline tool to convert text files to speech for accessibility or convenience

High-Level Features
- Clean and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter
- Choice of male or female voice for speech output
- Adjustable speech speed (fast, normal, slow)
- Listen to text in real-time at the click of a button
- Save audio output as MP3 in a user-selected directory
- Works entirely offline without external dependencies beyond Python libraries
